			<div class="section-heading"> Addressing biases in the field of animal behaviour</div>
			
			<p style="text-align: justify; padding: 0 4em; line-height: 1.8;"> 
				Animal behaviour research is affected by researchers' assumptions and expectations,
				impacting how the research is conducted, interpretations of behaviours,
				the research questions addressed, and taxonomic representation. In addition,
				the choice of which animal subject to include is not random, as recently summarised by the STRANGE framework.
				The robustness of research findings can also often be unclear without replications and open science practices. 
				Finally, like other academic fields, animal behaviour is also shaped by historical biases
				influencing whose research is recognised as influential and skewing the scientific discourse. </br></br>

				Recognising the impacts of these biases presents an opportunity for positive change.
				At the ASAB Winter Meeting 2024, we explore biases in animal behaviour research, and
				discuss a comprehensive system change towards fairness and inclusion of diverse perspectives.
				To ensure new insights and more robust science, this transformative shift involves
				evaluating community needs, fostering cultural changes, and implementing explicit policies. </br></br>
				
				We aim to publish a special issue with conference proceedings.

					<strong>Malin Ah-King, Stockholm University/Örebro University, SWE </strong>
					<p  style="line-height: 1.5;">
						Malin Ah-King is an Associate Professor in Gender Studies at Stockholm University/Örebro University, Sweden. 
						She is an evolutionary biologist (PhD) and gender researcher focusing on gender/queer perspectives on biology and feminist science studies of contemporary sexual selection research. 
						Her current project explores a controversy over sex differences in evolutionary biology. 
						She investigates the relationship between science and society through analysing the production of scientific knowledge as well as ignorance.
						She has published in biological and gender journals, and makes regular contributions to radio, newsprint and podcasts.

					<strong>Tatsuya Amano, The University of Queensland, AUS </strong>
					<p style="line-height: 1.5;">
						Tatsuya is a conservation scientist, committed to making the conservation community, and more broadly academia, more evidence-based, diverse, and inclusive. 
						Tatsuya has been leading <a href="https://translatesciences.com/" target="_blank">the translatE project</a>,
						which aims to understand the consequences of language barriers in science. 
						The project has shown how language barriers can impede evidence-based biodiversity conservation in three major ways: 
						barriers to (1) the global synthesis of scientific evidence, (2) the application of English-language evidence to local decision making, and (3) the generation of scientific evidence by non-native English speakers. 
						Tatsuya works as a Senior Lecturer at the School of the Environment and Centre for Biodiversity and Conservation Science, at The University of Queensland.

					<strong>Antica Čulina, Ruđer Bošković Insitute, HRV</strong>
					<p style="line-height: 1.5;">
						My work lies on the interface between open science and meta-science in ecology. 
						With this, I strive to enable ecological research to reach its full potential by researching the scientific process itself, understanding and optimizing it. 
						Before I moved into open science research, I studied the evolutionary ecology of pair bonds, and life-history trade-offs, using mostly birds as a model system. 
						I have co-founded <a href="https://www.spibirds.org/" target="_blank">SPI-Birds Network and Database</a> and 
						the Society for Open, Reliable, and Transparent Ecology and Evolutionary biology (<a href="https://www.sortee.org/" target="_blank">SORTEE</a>). 
						Further, I contribute to other open science initiatives such as GoFAIR discovery in, UNESCO Open Science, and Research Data Alliance. 
						I work as a senior research associate at the Ruđer Bošković Institute, Croatia. 
						Before moving back to Croatia, I did my PhD in evolutionary ecology at the University of Oxford, and then worked as a researcher (on open science in ecology) at the Netherlands Institute of Ecology.
